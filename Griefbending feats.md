>Your focus returns to the little mass of Grief floating above your left hand. It's... you know that you can reshape it as you like, and it's liquid, solid, or gas, as you like. You curl your fingers, and it warps through various simple shapes: sphere, pyramid, cube. Your other hand comes up, and the Grief reshapes itself into a little statuette of Kyuubey.

>You... reshape the Grief into a small, thirty centimeter long blade of Grief. You're already controlling it at a distance, so... You swipe at a conveniently placed old car with the hand manipulating the Grief.

>The blade flickers out, and carves clear through the rusting steel in a spray of sparks. The cut edges glow a deep purple that's almost black. The colour rapidly fades, and you swing again, twirling on the spot as you do. This time, you bisect the car lengthwise, and you instinctively finish the twirl in a half crouch before taking a long hop into the air. As you fall, your bring the Grief down again, now reshaping it into a simple plate that you smash into the car from above.

>Metal shrieks as it's crushed into the ground, completely pancaking the car.

>You quickly return to your testing... and reshape the Grief into a simple sphere again. You push it away from you, snaking it among the piles of junk, trying to see what the limits of your control are...

>You lose control of the Grief at a hundred meters away, and you can feel it try to maintain its coherence, to consolidate, before it dissipates. It simply spreads out, like a mist the vanishes in the morning sunlight.

>You scratch your head. "Ah... I've lost it," you admit to the others with a depreciative chuckle. "I guess that's my range limit, then."
