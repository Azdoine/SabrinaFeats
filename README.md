This is where I'm drafting my Sabrina RT.

*"Make your own version of the story. There's no reason you can't tell a different story with the same pieces, right?"*

*Sayaka sticks her tongue out at you, and then turns to Madoka. "Her brain damage is acting up again," she says in a stage whisper.*

# Bio

A girl without a past, [Sabrina's](https://placeholder.com) first memories are of waking up on the brink of death, quickly choosing to become a Magical Girl just to survive. However, armed with knowledge of invaluable allies and powerful secrets, as well as the priceless ability to break some of the most ironclad rules of magic, she immediately devoted herself to the task of saving herself and others from the brutal suffering and exploitation they endured under the Magical Girl system, and eventually resolved to nurture and protect her new life instead of searching for a history she mightn't even have.

As a Magical Girl, Sabrina makes her home in Mitakihara city with her girlfriend, [Mami Tomoe](https://placeholder.com), and the rest of team White Ribbon ([Homura Akemi](https://placeholder.com), [Sayaka Miki](https://placeholder.com), [Madoka Kaname](https://placeholder.com) and [Hitomi Shizuki](https://placeholder.com)). Other major allies of hers include the [ruthlessly-befriended](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship) "Third Eye" pair ([Oriko Mikuni and Kirika Kure](https://placeholder.com)), the Pleiades Saints ([Kazumi, who used to be Mami's student, and her own pupils](https://placeholder.com)), and the Fukushima Mercenary Group (a group of freelancers in a mutual defense pact with White Ribbon). Her primary enemies are the manipulative [Incubators](https://placeholder.com), who created the Magical Girl system, and the enigmatic entity known only as ["Feathers"](https://placeholder.com).

Though Sabrina's exact origins still remain unknown, she and Homura both suspect she was created by Madoka's wish "that everything could be fixed" in a prior (now otherwise defunct) timeline.

(Sabrina is the primary character and protagonist of [Puella Magi Adfligo Systema](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/puella-magi-adfligo-systema.2538/), an ongoing play-by-post roleplay managed by [Firnagzen](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/members/firnagzen.386/) and based on the [Madoka Magica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puella_Magi_Madoka_Magica) franchise. This respect thread is current to the latest story post as of the time of this writing (Lowlife, part ##), but covers no further material.)

# Basics

### Soul Gem

#### Dissociation

By virtue of being a Magical Girl, Sabrina's soul is seated within the Soul Gem she keeps on her person, rather than within her body. She is divorced from the limits and needs of her biological functions and can survive any amount of damage to her body so long as her Soul Gem remains intact.

* Suppresses the pain of getting her leg blown off by explosives.
  
* Completely no-sells a noxious gas.
  
* Powers through getting her ribs caved in.
  
* Another Magical Girl uses the same power to survive getting bisected.

#### Despair

As Sabrina uses her magical powers and experiences negative emotions, the corruption known as 'Grief' builds up in her Soul Gem until it's cleansed. If her Gem fills up completely with Grief, without being discharged, then she loses her sanity and transforms into a tortured monster known as a Witch.

* The presence of Grief within a Soul Gem encourages further negative emotions, opening the possibility of a runaway 'Grief Spiral'.

* Unlike other Magical Girls, Sabrina is able to cleanse her own Soul Gem at will, so this represents a manageable condition rather than a defining restriction on her lifestyle or combat tactics. (See 'Cleansing', under 'Wish Magic' below.)

#### Disconnection

If Sabrina's Soul Gem and body are moved more than 100 meters apart - or her connection to her body is otherwise disrupted, e.g. by no longer having a body to go back to at all - then she falls unconscious until reconnected.

* It's *possible* to learn to operate as a Soul Gem without a body, but Sabrina has yet to learn this skill.
