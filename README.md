This is where I'm drafting my Sabrina RT.

# Bio

A girl without a past, [Sabrina's](https://placeholder.com) first memories are of waking up on the brink of death, choosing to become a Magical Girl just to survive. However, armed with knowledge of invaluable allies and powerful secrets, as well as the priceless ability to break some of the most ironclad rules of magic, she quickly devoted herself to the task of saving herself and others from the brutal suffering and exploitation they endured under the Magical Girl system, choosing to nurture and protect her new life instead of searching for a history she mightn't even have.

As a Magical Girl, Sabrina makes her home in Mitakihara city with her girlfriend, [Mami Tomoe](https://placeholder.com), and the rest of team White Ribbon ([Homura Akemi](https://placeholder.com), [Sayaka Miki](https://placeholder.com), [Madoka Kaname](https://placeholder.com) and [Hitomi Shizuki](https://placeholder.com)). Other major allies of hers include the [ruthlessly-befriended](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship) "Third Eye" pair ([Oriko Mikuni and Kirika Kure](https://placeholder.com)), the Pleiades Saints ([Kazumi, who used to be Mami's student, and her own pupils](https://placeholder.com)), and the Fukushima Mercenary Group (a group of freelancers in a mutual defense pact with White Ribbon). Her primary enemies are the manipulative [Incubators](https://placeholder.com), who created the Magical Girl system, and the enigmatic entity known only as ["Feathers"](https://placeholder.com).

Though Sabrina's exact origins still remain unknown, she and Homura both suspect she was created by Madoka's wish "that everything could be fixed" in a prior (now otherwise defunct) timeline.

(Sabrina is the primary character and protagonist of [Puella Magi Adfligo Systema](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/puella-magi-adfligo-systema.2538/), an ongoing play-by-post roleplay managed by [Firnagzen](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/members/firnagzen.386/) and based on the [Madoka Magica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puella_Magi_Madoka_Magica) franchise. This respect thread is current to the latest story post as of the time of this writing (Lowlife, part ##), but covers no further material.)
