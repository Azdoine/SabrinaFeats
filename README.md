# Bio

A girl without a past, [Sabrina's](https://placeholder.com) first memories are of waking up on the brink of death, quickly choosing to become a Magical Girl just to survive. However, armed with knowledge of invaluable allies and powerful secrets, as well as the priceless ability to break some of the most ironclad rules of magic, she immediately devoted herself to the task of saving herself and others from the brutal suffering and exploitation they endured under the Magical Girl system, and eventually resolved to nurture and protect her new life instead of searching for a history she mightn't even have.

As a Magical Girl, Sabrina makes her home in Mitakihara city with her girlfriend, [Mami Tomoe](https://placeholder.com), and the rest of team White Ribbon ([Homura Akemi](https://placeholder.com), [Sayaka Miki](https://placeholder.com), [Madoka Kaname](https://placeholder.com) and [Hitomi Shizuki](https://placeholder.com)). Other major allies of hers include the [ruthlessly-befriended](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship) "Third Eye" pair ([Oriko Mikuni and Kirika Kure](https://placeholder.com)), the Pleiades Saints ([Kazumi, who used to be Mami's student, and her own pupils](https://placeholder.com)), and the Fukushima Mercenary Group (a group of freelancers in a mutual defense pact with White Ribbon). Her primary enemies are the manipulative [Incubators](https://placeholder.com), who created the Magical Girl system, and the enigmatic entity known only as ["Feathers"](https://placeholder.com).

Though Sabrina's exact origins still remain unknown, she and Homura both suspect she was created by Madoka's wish "that everything could be fixed" in a prior (now otherwise defunct) timeline.

(Sabrina is the primary character and protagonist of [Puella Magi Adfligo Systema](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/puella-magi-adfligo-systema.2538/), an ongoing play-by-post roleplay managed by [Firnagzen](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/members/firnagzen.386/) and based on the [Madoka Magica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puella_Magi_Madoka_Magica) franchise. This respect thread is current to the latest story post as of the time of this writing (Lowlife, part ##), but covers no further material.)

# Basics

### Soul Gem

#### Dissociation

By virtue of being a Magical Girl, Sabrina's soul is seated within the Soul Gem she keeps on her person, rather than within her body. She is divorced from the limits and needs of her biological functions and can survive any amount of damage to her body so long as her Soul Gem remains intact.

* Suppresses the pain of getting her leg blown off by explosives.
  
* Completely no-sells a noxious gas.
  
* Powers through getting her ribs caved in.
  
* Another Magical Girl uses the same power to survive getting bisected.

#### Despair

As Sabrina uses her magical powers and experiences negative emotions, the corruption known as 'Grief' builds up in her Soul Gem until it's cleansed. If her Gem fills up completely with Grief, without being discharged, then she loses her sanity and transforms into a tortured monster known as a Witch.

* The presence of Grief within a Soul Gem encourages further negative emotions, opening the possibility of a runaway 'Grief Spiral'.

* Unlike other Magical Girls, Sabrina is able to cleanse her own Soul Gem at will, so this represents a manageable condition rather than a defining restriction on her lifestyle or combat tactics. (See 'Cleansing', under 'Wish Magic' below.)

#### Disconnection

If Sabrina's Soul Gem and body are moved more than 100 meters apart - or her connection to her body is otherwise disrupted, e.g. by no longer having a body to go back to at all - then she falls unconscious until reconnected.

* It's *possible* to learn to operate as a Soul Gem without a body, but Sabrina has yet to learn this skill.

# Wish Magic

A Magical Girl's personal magic corresponds to the wish she makes in the terms of her contract with Kyubey. As Sabrina [wished to control "all Grief"](https://gist.github.com/Azdoine/cb3a2b5a5350775aca7d692d81ee7764) while posessing an unquantifiable level of magical potential, and magic itself is a function of emotions such as hope and despair, she recieved a particularly potent and open-ended form of meta-magic.

Because Grief is the source of the powers that Witches wield, Sabrina is careful about wielding certain particularly "Witch-like" abilities in the presence of other Magical Girls (who can sense the dark magic, and often react badly to pronounced use of it). Such feats are marked with a â€  below, and may put her into a partial or complete trance as she performs them.

### Cleansing

Sabrina is able to directly withdraw Grief from an active receptacle (typically a Magical Girl's Soul Gem) and keep it under her control without needing to transfer it into another container (where it would torment its bearer at best, or transform them into a Witch at worst).

* Cleanses # Soul Gems at a time.

Sabrina is also able to extract the Grief contained within Grief Seeds - the transformed Soul Gems of Witches, which Magical Girls ordinarily need to hunt down in order to discharge Grief into.

* Grief Seeds have a vastly greater capacity to hold Grief than Soul Gems do, [].

### Griefbending

Once taken under Sabrina's power (and not held by another or kept in another container), Grief manifests as a kind of idealized programmable matter which she can mentally move, reshape, and control at will.

The maximum range of Sabrina's control under normal circumstances is 100 meters, and her Grief dissipates beyond this radius.

* Reshapes Grief and passes it between solid, liquid, and gaseous phases at will.

* Uses Grief implements to wreck a car and a horde of a Witch's Familiars.

* Wrests control of Grief from a Witch and directly tears apart its Familiars, its Labyrinth, and its body.

* Disperses inert 'solid' Grief into nanoparticles too small to see.

  * Uses Grief nanoparticles to isolate and filter a noxious gas out of the atmosphere in real time.
  
  * Uses Grief nanoparticles to create an invisibly insulated air pocket.

* Builds a purely mechanical spectrometer using nanoscale mechanisms and perfect optical materials.

### Senses

Sabrina has total and passive proprioception over all Grief within her control radius.

* Discerns Magical Girls (and those with the potential to become Magical Girls) by the presence of the concentrated and structured Grief within them.

  * Senses a Magical Girl on the other side of an all-encompassing spatial distortion.
  
* Creates Grief nanostructures fine enough to detect the impacts of individual photons.
  
* Uses Grief nanoparticles for perfect three-dimensional tactile feedback.
