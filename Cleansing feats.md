>"Mami, may I borrow your Soul Gem?"

>...

>Mami hesitantly forms her Soul Gem in the palm of your hand. "OK, but please be careful..."

>She hovers near you as you accept the Soul Gem. You can see that it's shining gold, as it should, but obscured by a thin, filmy layer of darkness. The moment you touch it, though, you realize that you can do this. A lazy curl of the fingers of the hand not holding Mami's Soul Gem, and the layer of darkness flows out into the air, condensing into a malevolent, pulsing mass floating above your left hand. There's a deeper, more present feeling in the Gem you don't dare touch.

>"Here you go, Mami," you say, slightly less dreamy than you were a moment ago as mild shock sets in. You've just realized: you just cleansed a Soul Gem. You think you can do it at a distance, too, and... you check your own Soul Gem. It's barely darkened, and you know that you can cleanse the Grief off of it just as well.

>Mami accepts her Soul Gem back with slightly trembling hands, usually half-lidded gaze wide in shock.
